# BetterRest
BetterRest aims to create an iOS app that utilizes machine learning(CoreML) to provide users with personalized bedtime recommendations.
1. Wake-up Time 🛏️: Users will provide the time they want to wake up in the morning. This essential piece of information serves as the starting point for calculating their ideal bedtime.
2.Desired Sleep Duration 🤌: The app will ask users to specify the number of hours of sleep they desire. This input helps customize the bedtime recommendation to meet their sleep needs.
3.Daily Coffee Consumption ☕️: Users will indicate the number of cups of coffee they typically consume during the day. This data point plays a crucial role in determining when caffeine intake should be reduced to ensure a good night's sleep.

 This is the 4th project I have done within the scope of swiftUI in 100 days.
