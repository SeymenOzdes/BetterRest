# BetterRest
BetterRest aims to create an iOS app that utilizes machine learning to provide users with personalized bedtime recommendations. By collecting information about the user's desired wake-up time, desired sleep duration, and daily coffee consumption, the app will calculate and present an ideal bedtime, helping users improve their sleep quality. This is the 4th project I have done within the scope of swiftUI in 100 days.
